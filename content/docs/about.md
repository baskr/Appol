## ABOUT

Web applications like Facebook Messenger, Google Inbox, WhatsApp Web are becoming more and more like desktop applications every day. But running each of these web apps in a separate tab in your browser can be a real pain and make you work less productive.

WebCatalog lets you download and use thousands of web apps with the same experiences you have with native apps:

- Full-screen and **distraction-free**
- Can be easily opened from macOS's **Launchpad & Dock** or Windows's **Start menu**.
- Can be easily switched between apps on macOS's **Dock** or Windows's **Taskbar**.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

**WebCatalog for Desktop** built on top of [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier), a library based on the Node.js runtime environment which can convert any web page into an automated desktop application. Nativefier does this using a framework called [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). The Electron framework enables a programmer to write desktop applications in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

**WebCatalog for Mobile** built on top of the standalone mode supported on [Android](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen) and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html).
