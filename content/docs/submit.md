## SUBMIT NEW APP VIA GITHUB (advanced)

Before submitting your app, please notice that while WebCatalog for Desktop (Windows, macOS and Linux) supports any web apps, WebCatalog for Mobile (Android and iOS) only supports web apps that support `standalone` mode. You can check out these documents [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), [2](https://gist.github.com/irae/1042167), [3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag), [4](https://developer.apple.com/library/iad/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/OfflineApplicationCache/OfflineApplicationCache.html)] to make sure if your app does, or you can only submit your app for desktop users.

To submit a new app, please [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-on-projects-using-pull-requests/) with these following changes.

### STEP 1
Add new app entry in `/content/app/_APP_ID.md` in this following format:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/quanglam2807/a0197a93f2c96e7dc576.js"></script>

- `id`, `title`, `app_url`, `categories`, `platforms`, `description` are required.

- `developer`: The name of the developer of the app (company or individual), not the person who submit the app.

- `categories`: The category IDs of the app (based on [Windows Store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt148528.aspx)). Maximum 2.

    - books-reference
    - business
    - developer-tool
    - education
    - entertainment
    - food  
    - games
    - government
    - health
    - kids-family
    - lifestyle
    - medical   
    - multimedia
    - music
    - navigation
    - news-weather
    - finance   
    - photo-video
    - productivity
    - shopping  
    - social
    - sports
    - travel
    - utilities

- `ios_title`: Provide if you want to use an alternative name for iOS home screen. [What is the maximum length the iOS application name can be?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6094954/what-is-the-maximum-length-the-ipad-application-name-can-be)


- `ios_status_bar_style`: The iOS status bar style of your app. Set to `default`, the status bar appears normal. If set to `black`, the status bar has a black background. If set to `black-translucent`, the status bar is black and translucent. If set to `default` or `black`, the web content is displayed below the status bar. If set to `black-translucent`, the web content is displayed on the entire screen, partially obscured by the status bar. If this field is not set, `default` will be used.

- `description`: There is no limit on the length but only 120 characters of the description will be displayed in the list view.

### STEP 2
Create a folder named `_APP_ID` in `static/app` and add these following required icon files in the newly created folder.

`windows.png` (if you want to support Windows desktop): 1024x102zpx, should be transparent.

`linux.png` (if you want to support Linux desktop): 1024x1024px, should be transparent.

`osx.png` (if you want to support macOS): 1024x1024px, should be transparent. [Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/IconsGraphics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH14-SW1). macOS icon will be the icon displayed on the website.

`ios.png` (if you want to support iOS): 512x512px, should be not transparent and rounded. Rounded corners of the icon will be handled by iOS. [Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html)

`android.png` (if you want to support Android): 512x512px, should be transparent. [Design Guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html)

As soon as your pull request is merged and a release tag is set, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) will automatically compile and publish the app on WebCatalog.
